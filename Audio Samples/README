The files from the 18 december 2018 are done with my first antenna design.
The files from the 23 december 2018 are made with my second antenna design.
The main difference between the 2 is than the second design is shielded,
which provide a much better protection against the external sources of noise
like the hum.

All files are 24 bits 48KHz stereo flac files recorded as wav files with
a Zomm H4n and converted to flac with flac on gentoo linux.
