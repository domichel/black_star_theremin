Documentation of a vacuum tubes theremin hardware

I am slowly transforming an antique philips BS351AF vacuum tubes radio into a theremin. As things begin to work well, you will find its documentation inclusive the schematic here.

A theremin is one of the first electronic musical instrument that was developped. It use radio frequencies to generate the sound and control the volume. This theremin is named the Black Star Theremin because a good friend have a very funny black border collie named Star.

The advantage to use and old vacuum tubes radio to make a theremin is that such an antique radio will provide you most of the needed spare parts. Thanks to Fredrik from Sveriges radiohistoriska f√∂rening for providing the schematics of the BS451AF (http://www.radiohistoriska.se/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1174), a very similar model.

The Black Star Theremin have a feature which make it unique: the antennas are physically separated from the device by 2 coaxial cables. I took that decision because the original radio was quite big and I didn't wanted to have it in my way when playing the instrument.

The result is a very funny instrument to play. The audio output transformer is of outstanding quality, which imply I can use that instrument as a guitar amplifier and get better sounds with it than with my Fender Champ.

Be aware this is a work in progress, but it is already working good enough to begin the second stage of its development. I will be playing it and asking experimented theremin players to play it and to give me their comments. From these, I will hopefully be able to fine adjust it in oder to make a fun to play of professional quality musical instrument.

The schematics is made with gschem on GNU/linux. It is a hierarchical schematic, its main page is Theremin.sch which will let you to navigate into the different shematic parts and symbols.

I made a separated DC regulated supply for the filaments. It is on a separated page named DC_Heater_Supply.sch.
