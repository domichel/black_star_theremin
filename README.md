Documentation of a vacuum tubes theremin hardware

I am slowly transforming an old vacuum tubes radio into a theremin. As things begin to work well, I will share the documentation inclusive the schematic here.

A theremin is one of the first electronic musical instrument that was developped. It use radio frequencies to generate the sound and control the volume. This theremin is named Black Star theremin because a good friend have a very funny black border collie named Star.

The advantage to use and old vacuum tubes radio to make a theremin is that such an antique radio will provide you most of the needed spare parts.

The Black Star theremin have a feature which make it unique: the antennas are physically separated from the device by 2 coaxial cables. I took that decision because the original radio was quite big and I didn't wanted to have it in my way when plaing the instrument.

The result is a very funny instrument to play. The audio output transformer is of outstanding quality, which imply I can use that instrument as a guitar amplifier and get better sounds with it than with my Fender Champ.

Be aware this is a work in progress, some individual parts are allready working very well when others will be improved. The schematics was made with gschem on GNU/linux.
